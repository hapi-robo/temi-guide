Official source code and documentation for temi's SDK can be found at the following:

- `Source Code <https://github.com/robotemi/sdk>`_
- `Documentation <https://github.com/robotemi/sdk/wiki>`_

The documentation here acts as supplementary material. It goes into more detail and provides various examples. For any issues concerning the documentation and/or examples, please raise an `issue <https://github.com/hapi-robo/temi-guide/issues>`_.


Apps Marketplace
================
  temi provides an `apps marketplace <https://market.robotemi.com/apps>`, which can be used to distribute your apps to temi robots worldwide. Apps distributed through the marketplace will officially be supported by temi. Apps that are distributed outside the marketplace (e.g. installed via ADB) will not be supported by temi.


.. Important::
  Due to the ability to put an app in ``Kiosk Mode``, it is strongly recommended that apps have an **Exit** button. Without this, there are situations where the robot may become unusable. During development, it is recommended that developers install a `navigation bar <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nu.nav.bar&gl=US>` to avoid such situations.
