Distribution & Support
======================
  temi provides an `apps marketplace <https://market.robotemi.com/apps>`, which can be used to distribute apps to temi robots worldwide. Apps distributed through the marketplace will officially be supported by temi. Apps that are distributed outside the marketplace (e.g. installed via ADB) will not be supported by temi.


.. Important::
  Due to the ability to set an app in ``Kiosk Mode``, it is strongly recommended that apps have an **Exit** button. Without this, there are known situations where the robot may become completely unusable. During development, it is recommended that developers install a `navigation bar <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nu.nav.bar&gl=US>` to avoid such situations.
