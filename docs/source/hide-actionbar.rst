Hide ActionBar & Pull-Down Bar
==============================

For Kiosk applications, you'll want to hide the temi's `ActionBar <https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/appcompat/app/ActionBar>`_.

  temi's ActionBar.

You can hide the ActionBar with the following command.

.. code-block:: Java

  Robot.getInstance().hideTopBar()

But that will still leave a pull-down bar, which users can use to get access to temi's ActionBar.

  temi's pull-down bar. By pulling down on this, the user can reveal temi's ActionBar.

How To
------
To completely hide temi's ActionBar (including the pull-down bar), you'll need to make the following changes.


AndroidManifest.xml
+++++++++++++++++++
Add the following ``meta-data`` to your ``MainActivity``.

.. code-block:: xml

  <activity android:name=".MainActivity">
    ...
    <meta-data
        android:name="com.robotemi.sdk.metadata.UI_MODE"
        android:value="4" />
    ...
  </activity>

  
onRobotReady()
+++++++++++++++++
Add the following code after the robot is ready.

.. code-block:: Java

  @Override
  public void onRobotReady(boolean isReady) {
      if (isReady) {
          try {
            ActivityInfo activityInfo = getPackageManager().getActivityInfo(getComponentName(), PackageManager.GET_META_DATA);
            Robot.getInstance().onStart(activityInfo);
          } catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
          }
      }
  }


Exit Button
-----------
Now that you've completely removed the ActionBar, you will need a way to exit the application. For a Kiosk application, you'll probably want to hide the exit button and use a password to prevent the device from being tampered with.

To return to the Launcher menu, use the following command.

.. code-block:: Java

  Robot.getInstance().showAppList();

.. Tip::
  In case you've made a Kiosk app and forgot to include the exit button, one way to get out of it is to call your robot. Starting a telepresence session with the robot (from temi Mobile App or temi Center) will bring up temi's ActionBar.
