"The robot comes equipped with a suite of optical sensors that are used "
"for navigation. As with all optical sensors, environmental lighting, as "
"well as surface reflection, transmission, and absorption affect what the "
"sensors are able to detect. In turn, these can affect navigation "
"performance."
