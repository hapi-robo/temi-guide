"`Q: Are there signal strength requirements for temi Mobile App and/or "
"temi Center?`"

"First some background information: Signal strength for the robot is "
"provided because the robot moves around in the environment. The signal "
"strength changes depending on where it is. Access points have a tendency "
"to automatically lower connection bandwidth if the signal strength is "
"below a threshold."

"In general, a user that is using the temi Mobile App and/or temi Center "
"(on a PC) will not continuously move around the environment like the "
"robot. In general, the signal strength will remain the same. So if the "
"bandwidth requirement is met for these devices, there should be no issue."

"`Q: What is the range of activity achievable by temi? Can we cover a "
"radius of 50 m from the home base?`"

"The range of activity is limited by Wi-Fi signal strength and this is "
"dependent on hundreds of environmental factors. See :ref:`temi-robot-"
"wifi-requirements` for details."

"`Q: The recommendation is to use 5 GHz for Wi-Fi connection, but I "
"understand that 5 GHz has a shorter range in comparison to 2.4 GHz.`"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/network-admin/21_faq.rst:17 9b88b18a815b4838b5bbbec7a2f6a745
msgid ""
"It is true that for the same amount of power 5 GHz has a shorter range "
"than 2.4 GHz, but that is not important here. What is important is the "
"Wi-Fi signal strength. If the signal strength meets the requirements, the"
" robot can use either 2.4 GHz or 5.0 GHz."
