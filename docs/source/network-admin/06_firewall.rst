Firewall Settings
=================

A list of the IP/FQDNs and port numbers that are used by temi Robots, temi Mobile App, and temi Center are provided in the following CSV file. For changes to previous versions, see :ref:`firewall-changelogs`.

:download:`Firewall Settings (2022/02/09) <assets/temi_firewall_settings_20220209.csv>`

Whitelist only those IP/FQDNs and port numbers that you want to use. 

.. admonition:: Recommendations

  The last column labeled ``Recommended``, in the CSV file, provides the minimum set needed for establishing telepresence sessions and OTA software updates.

The latest firewall settings have been tested on the following software versions using a `Netgate 1100 Security Gateway <https://docs.netgate.com/pfsense/en/latest/solutions/sg-1100/>`_ running `pfSense 21.02.2 <https://www.pfsense.org/>`_.

.. _proxy-settings:

Proxy Settings
==============
temi Center uses WebSockets for establishing video connection and for controlling the robot remotely. Therefore, proxy servers should be configured to allow for WebSocket connections. The :ref:`firewall-settings` document at the top of this page has a column labelled ``WebSockets`` that indicates which FQDN/IPs and ports use WebSockets.

Troubleshooting
===============
After configuring your network with the settings described above, if you are still not able to use the temi Robot, temi Mobile App, and/or temi Center, please check the following:

Firewall Settings
-----------------
- Use the most recent firewall settings. The latest version is provided as a CSV file at the top of this page. 
- Do not convert FQDN addresses to IP addresses. FQDNs are used because the underlying IP addresses may change without notice.
- Connect a PC to your firewall-configured network and check if it is able to reach each of the FQDN/IPs listed in your firewall settings. Note that some domains block/drop ICMP packets (there is an ``ICMP Blocked`` column of the :ref:`firewall-settings` document), so `ping` cannot reliably be used to check this. In this case, one can use one of the following::

    nmap -sn center.robotemi.com
    host center.robotemi.com

Proxy Settings
--------------
Your proxy servers may not allow for WebSocket connections. You can test your WebSocket with `this <https://libwebsockets.org/testserver/>`_. If the WebSocket connection is working, you should see:

- You should see a number incrementing
- The number resets if you click on the ``Reset counter`` button

Web Browser
-----------
- Are you using the latest version of a supported web-browser?
- Do you have any additional web-browser security features (apart from the default set) enabled?
- Are microphone and video allowed to operate through the web-browser?
  
  - Test microphone: https://webcammictest.com/check-mic.html
  - Test video: https://webcammictest.com/
