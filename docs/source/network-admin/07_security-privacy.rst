Android Debug Bridge
====================
`Android Debug Bridge (ADB) <https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb>`_ is a tool that let's developers communicate with the temi Robot. One can enable this feature under ``Settings`` > ``Developer Tools``, then tapping `ADB Port Opening`. This will open port ``5555`` on the robot. To disable this feature and close the port, you must reboot the robot.

.. Caution:: 

  Enabling temi's ADB port posses some risks. There exists malware/viruses that specifically target this port. If there are devices on the network that have such malware, temi Robot can be infected. We recommend the following:

    - Only connect temi Robot to a closed network that is malware-free for development.
    - Never enable the ADB port in production.

  It is impossible to know if the ADB port was accidentally opened. When in doubt, reboot the robot to close the port. 


Auditing
