Measuring Wi-Fi Signal Strength
===============================

.. Attention:: Wi-Fi signal strength must be measured using the wireless device that will be using Wi-Fi. For example, do not measure Wi-Fi signal strength using a smartphone when the Wi-Fi signal will be used by the robot. The antennas on the smartphone and robot are different, which will make the Wi-Fi signal strength measurements different.

Use the following instructions to measure Wi-Fi signal strength on the robot.

  Tap on the Wi-Fi icon in the top left-hand corner to bring up the Wi-Fi network selection menu.

  Here you should see a line displaying the ``Signal strength`` in the units of `dBm`. This represents the Wi-Fi signal strength for the robot.
