General Network Requirements
============================

- Broadband internet access. Wired connection preferred, over a CAT-5 ethernet cable.

- A connection to temi Cloud. For more details, refer to :ref:`firewall-settings`.

.. admonition:: Recommendations

  Internet bandwidth of `at least` 3 Mbps upload and 3 Mbps download speeds.

.. Note:: One easy way to test internet bandwidth is to connect a PC to the same LAN as the robot and open a web-browser to the following link https://www.speedtest.net/ to run an in-browser bandwidth test.
