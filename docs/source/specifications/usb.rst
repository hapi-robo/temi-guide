Hardware
========
The temi Robot v2 CE is equipped with a USB Host port (5V/900mA, 4.5W).


USB Host Ports
==============
USB host ports are the standard ports found on desktop computers and laptops. They can be used to attach USB peripherals, like mouse, keyboard, microphone, webcam, etc. 

temi's USB Host port is meant to be used by an Android developer that wants to create an application that, for example, uses a USB thermal camera. It is also compatible with some 4G/LTE dongles aimed specifically at the Chinese market, which allows temi to operate on a mobile connection instead of Wi-Fi.
